# Simple "Under Construction" site for SSGandCO

How to use:
1. Copy the `index.html` and `styles.css` files into a `docs/` folder in your repository root:
   - docs/index.html
   - docs/styles.css
2. Go to your repository Settings → Pages and publish the `main` branch from the `docs/` folder (or enable GitHub Pages from the `docs` folder).
3. Alternatively, push these files to a `gh-pages` branch and enable Pages to serve from that branch.

Quick edits:
- Edit the message inside `<p id="customMessage">...</p>` to change the construction message.
- Update the email in the "Notify me" button.
- Replace the banner by editing `.banner-graphic` in `styles.css` or substituting an image.

Want me to commit these files for you?
- Tell me which branch to push to (main/docs or create gh-pages) and I can push the files.
